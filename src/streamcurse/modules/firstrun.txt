NORMAL MODE: You do not have any streams in this database yet.
TWITCH MODE: You need to sync with a valid username

	you can set a default username in config.ini
	if username is set to None then you will be asked for one when syncing

heres some options:
  a/A : add a stream to the current database
   c  : to cycle through your databases
   C  : to create a new database
   w  : to sync twitch mode
